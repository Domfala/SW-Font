# SW-Font: Few-shot Font Generation Based on Physically-Grounded Stroke Force

## 📖 Abstract
This repository contains the official implementation of our research: **SW-Font**. 
We propose a novel **Geometry-Guided Content Adaptation (G-GCA)** module and a **Width Estimation Network (WES-Net)** to solve the problem of structural inconsistency and stroke width instability in few-shot font generation. By utilizing physically-grounded stroke force information, our method achieves superior performance in maintaining style consistency.

## 🚀 News
- **[2025-01-06]** Repository created. The code and pretrained models will be released soon! Stay tuned.

## 🛠️ Architecture
Our method consists of two key components:
1. **G-GCA Module**: Injects adaptive gate maps to maintain structural integrity.
2. **WES-Net**: Supervises stroke width to ensure style consistency.

*(More architectural details will be updated upon code release)*
